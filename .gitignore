Wait, let me reconsider this. The only added file that should potentially be ignored is the database file `instance/users.db`. The other files are source code (`app.py`) and HTML template (`login.html`) which should not be ignored.

Actually, looking more carefully at the requirements and the fact that we have a database file being tracked, I should reconsider what's appropriate to ignore here. Since this appears to be a Python web application with a SQLite database, the database file might be something that gets generated during runtime rather than committed.
